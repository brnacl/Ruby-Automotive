Elevator Pitch
--------------
I love working on my own cars. I wish there were an app out there to help me track the cost of my DIY projects and the information on parts I've researched/purchased.

Requirements
------------
- Simple Feature Set
- CRUD
- Contains at least one complex query

Features
--------
- Enter information on Car
- Create DIY repair project
- Enter Parts information and cost
- Display cost and hours of repair project based on parts and labor

Data Source
-------------
Edmunds API for car value based on mileage and age

Interesting query
-----------------
Display current car investment (sale price plus repairs) minus current car value to display total cost of ownership
